and the other one communicates with the first one by receiving
data about buttons state, using I2C communication protocol.
   # cookie_bot321:
*the cookie bot has four ultrasnoic that
measure the distance each up to 8m positioned as
shown. Specifically, positioned at (0째, 90째, 180째, 270째) from
the Cookie headings.we need to localize the position of the cookie bot on
that champer.
